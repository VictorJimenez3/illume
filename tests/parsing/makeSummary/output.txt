It serves as a representative case that helps to make something abstract more concrete and understandable. Examples can take various forms, such as instances, cases, illustrations, or models, and are used to demonstrate how something works, what something looks like, or how a principle applies in a particular situation. The primary purpose of an example is to enhance comprehension by providing a tangible and relatable point of reference. Without examples, understanding can remain theoretical and difficult to apply in practical situations.", "detailed_explanation": "In the provided context, \"example\" refers to the specific purpose of the 'example domain'. This domain is explicitly designated to be used as a demonstrative case in various documents and literature. This means that individuals can utilize this domain name in their writing or explanations to illustrate how domain names function, without needing to seek any form of authorization or agreement from the domain owners. The domain serves as a practical and readily available example for anyone needing to showcase a domain in their work.", "status": "success"}
