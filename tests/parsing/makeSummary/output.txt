The three main parts of your nervous system are your brain, spinal cord and nerves. It helps you move, think and feel. It even regulates the things you do but don\u2019t think about like digestion. It contains the central nervous system and the peripheral nervous system.\n\nCare at Cleveland Clinic\nNeurology Care for Adults\nNeurology Care for Children\nMake an Appointment\nContents\nOverview\nFunction\nAnatomy\nConditions and Disorders\nCare\nContents\nOverview\nFunction\nAnatomy\nConditions and Disorders\nCare\nOverview\nYour nervous system contains your brain, spinal cord and nerves.\nWhat is the nervous system?\n\nYour nervous system is your body\u2019s command center. It\u2019s made up of your brain, spinal cord and nerves. Your nervous system works by sending messages, or electrical signals, between your brain and all the other parts of your body. These signals tell you to breathe, move, speak and see, for example. Your nervous system keeps track of what\u2019s going on inside and outside of your body and decides how to respond to any situation you\u2019re in.\n\nYour nervous system regulates complicated processes like thoughts and memory. It also plays an essential role in the things your body does without thinking, like blushing, sweating and blinking.\n\nFunction\nWhat does the nervous system do?\n\nYour nervous system\u2019s main function is to send messages from various parts of your body to your brain, and from your brain back out to your body to tell your body what to do. These messages regulate your:\n\nThoughts, memory, learning and feelings.\nMovements (balance and coordination).\nSenses (how your brain interprets what you see, hear, taste, touch and feel).\nWound healing.\nSleep.\nHeartbeat and breathing patterns.\nResponse to stressful situations, including sweat production.\nDigestion.\nBody processes, such as puberty and aging.\nHow does the nervous system work?\n\nYour nervous system uses nerve cells called neurons to send signals, or messages, all over your body. These electrical signals travel among your brain, skin, organs, glands and muscles.\n\nThe messages help you move your limbs and feel sensations, like pain. Your eyes, ears, tongue, nose and the nerves all over your body take in information about your environment. Then, nerves carry that data to and from your brain.\n\nThere are different types of neurons. Each type of neuron has a different job:\n\nMotor neurons take signals from your brain and spinal cord to your muscles. They help you move. They also assist with breathing, swallowing and speaking.\nSensory neurons take information from your senses (what you see, touch, taste, etc.) to your brain.\nInterneurons communicate between motor and sensory neurons. These neurons regulate your movement in response to sensory information (like moving away from a hot surface) and play a role in how you learn, think and remember.\nAnatomy\nWhat are the parts of the nervous system?\n\nThe nervous system has two main parts:\n\nCentral nervous system (CNS):\u00a0Your brain and spinal cord make up your CNS. Your brain reads signals from your nerves to regulate how you think, move and feel.\nPeripheral nervous system (PNS): Your PNS is made up of a network of nerves. The nerves branch out from your spinal cord. This system relays information from your brain and spinal cord to your organs, arms, legs, fingers and toes.\n\nThere are two parts to your peripheral nervous system:\n\nThe somatic nervous system guides your voluntary movements.\nThe autonomic nervous system regulates the activities you do without thinking about them (involuntary movements).\nWhat does the nervous system look like?\n\nNerve cells (neurons) are the basis of your nervous system. There are 100 billion neurons in your brain. These cells connect throughout your entire body.\n\nImagine your nervous system as a tree. Your central nervous system is the trunk of the tree that contains your brain and spinal cord. The tree branches are your peripheral nervous system (nerves). The branches extend from the truck (brain and spinal cord) to reach all parts of your body.\n\nConditions and Disorders\nWhat are common conditions or disorders that affect the nervous system?\n\nThere are many conditions that affect your nervous system. Some of the most common include:\n\nAlzheimer\u2019s disease.\nCancer.\nCerebral palsy.\nEpilepsy.\nHuntington\u2019s disease.\nInfection (meningitis).\nParkinson\u2019s disease.\nStroke.\nTraumatic brain injury.\nWhat are common signs or symptoms of nervous system conditions?\n\nSigns and symptoms of nervous system conditions vary by type but may include:\n\nMovement and coordination changes.\nMemory loss.\nPain, numbness or a pins and needles feeling.\nBehavioral and mood changes.\nDifficulty with thinking and reasoning.\nSeizures.\n\nSome conditions, like a stroke, are medical emergencies that need treatment quickly. If you notice the following symptoms, contact 911 or your local emergency services number:\n\nMuscle weakness or paralysis in one side of your body.\nSudden vision loss.\nSlurred speech.\nConfusion.\nWhat tests check the health of your nervous system?\n\nA healthcare provider may use one of the following tests to check the health of your nervous system:\n\nComputed tomography (CT) scan.\nElectrocardiogram (ECG or EKG).\nElectroencephalogram (EEG).\nLumbar puncture (spinal tap).\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans.\nHow are conditions that affect the nervous system treated?\n\nA healthcare provider will review your symptoms to diagnose and treat any conditions that affect your nervous system. Treatment varies for each condition. So, your healthcare provider will take into consideration several factors, like your age and general health, to create your treatment plan. This plan may include:\n\nTaking medications.\nHaving surgery.\nParticipating in counseling for mental and emotional support.\nReceiving supportive care (to keep you comfortable).\nCare\nHow do I keep my nervous system healthy?\n\nYou can keep your nervous system healthy by:\n\nSeeing a healthcare provider regularly.\nMaintaining good health (like eating balanced foods).\nAvoiding harmful substances (like not smoking tobacco).\nWearing protective gear or equipment (a helmet) when playing sports or participating in certain activities.\nManaging any underlying health conditions.\nWhen should I call a healthcare provider?\n\nContact a healthcare provider right away if you notice sudden changes to your health like:\n\nMuscle weakness.\nVision problems or severe headaches.\nSlurred speech.\nNumbness, tingling or loss of sensation in your arms or legs.\nTremors or tics (random muscle movements).\nChanges in behavior or memory.\nProblems with coordination or moving your muscles.\n\nIf you or a loved one shows signs of a stroke or seizure, contact 911 or your local emergency services number.\n\nA note from Cleveland Clinic\n\nYour nervous system is the command center for your entire body. It helps you think, learn, move and remember. This vast network of nerves connects to all of your organs, muscles and glands. It needs care to keep working. Sometimes, unexpected events can affect your nervous system, like an infection, injury or underlying condition. A healthcare provider can help you stay healthy so your nervous system has all it needs to function as expected.\n\nCare at Cleveland Clinic\n\nIf you have a neurological condition, you want expert advice. At Cleveland Clinic, we\u2019ll work to create a treatment plan that\u2019s right for you.\n\nNeurology Care for Adults\nNeurology Care for Children\nMake an Appointment\nMedically Reviewed\n\nLast reviewed on 11/16/2023.\n\nLearn more about the Health Library and our editorial process.\n\nReferences\nAppointments\n866.588.2264\nAPPOINTMENTS & LOCATIONS\nREQUEST AN APPOINTMENT\nActions\nAppointments & Access\nAccepted Insurance\nEvents Calendar\nFinancial Assistance\nGive to Cleveland Clinic\nPay Your Bill Online\nRefer a Patient\nPhone Directory\nVirtual Second Opinions\nVirtual Visits\nBlog, News & Apps\nConsult QD\nHealth Essentials\nNewsroom\nMyClevelandClinic\nMyChart\nAbout Cleveland Clinic\n100 Years of Cleveland Clinic\nAbout Us\nLocations\nQuality & Patient Safety\nPatient Experience\nResearch & Innovations\nCommunity Commitment\nCareers\nFor Employees\nResources for Medical Professionals\nSite Information & Policies\nSend Us Feedback\nSite Map\nAbout this Website\nCopyright, Reprint & Licensing\nWebsite Terms of Use\nPrivacy Policy\nNotice of Privacy Practices\nNon-Discrimination Notice\n9500 Euclid Avenue, Cleveland, Ohio 44195 | 800.223.2273 | \u00a9 2025 Cleveland Clinic.

They are specialized to detect stimuli such as touch, taste, smell, sight, and sound. When a sensory neuron is stimulated, it generates an electrical signal that travels along its length to the brain or spinal cord. Different types of sensory neurons are responsible for detecting different types of stimuli. For example, photoreceptors in the eye detect light, while mechanoreceptors in the skin detect pressure. The brain then interprets these signals, allowing you to perceive the world around you. Sensory neurons are essential for our ability to interact with our environment, experience pleasure and pain, and maintain balance and coordination. They act as the critical link between the external world and our internal perceptions.", "detailed_explanation": "In the context of this article about the nervous system, sensory neurons are highlighted as a key component of how we experience and respond to the world. The article explains that sensory neurons are responsible for taking information from your senses \u2013 what you see, touch, taste, and so on \u2013 and delivering it to your brain. This is critical because without sensory neurons, the brain would not receive information about the environment, and therefore, we would not be able to perceive or react to stimuli. The article emphasizes the role of sensory neurons in the overall function of the nervous system, showing how they work in conjunction with motor neurons and interneurons to create a complex network for communication within the body.", "status": "success"}
