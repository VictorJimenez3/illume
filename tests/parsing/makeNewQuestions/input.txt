According to the text, what is required for the periods to extend the algebraic function?\n    a. An exponential period\n    b. A complex number\n    c. An integral\n    d. Product of an algebraic function and the exponential of an algebraic function\n\n3. Euler's constant is a well-known mathematical constant that is an exponential period.\n    True or false?\n\n4. The periods can be extended by permitting the integrand to be the product of an algebraic function and the ________ of an algebraic function.\n", "answers_raw": "1.  An exponential period\nExplanation: The text refers to extending periods using an \"exponential period,\" indicating it's a specific type of constant or element used in this process.\n\n \n\n2.  Product of an algebraic function and the exponential of an algebraic function\nExplanation: The extension of periods involves integrating functions that are the product of an algebraic function and the exponential of another algebraic function. This is a key construction mentioned in the context.\n\n \n\n3.  False\nExplanation: While Euler's constant is a well-known mathematical constant, the provided text does not explicitly state that it is an exponential period.\n\n \n\n4.  Exponential\nExplanation: The sentence explicitly states that the integrand should be the product of an algebraic function and the *exponential* of an algebraic function.\n"}
