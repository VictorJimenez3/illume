{"questions_raw": "1. Which of the following is true regarding number systems?\n    a. Real numbers are a subset of rational numbers.\n    b. Integers are a subset of natural numbers.\n    c. Natural numbers are a subset of integers.\n    d. Complex numbers are a subset of real numbers.\n2. Which civilization is credited with the earliest known use of a base-10 system?\n    a. Mesopotamians\n    b. Egyptians\n    c. Greeks\n    d. Romans\n3. True or False: The symbol 'i' used to represent the square root of -1 was first assigned by Gauss.\n4. The Hindu-Arabic numeral system's effectiveness was largely due to the symbol for _________.\n", "answers_raw": "Answer 1: c. Natural numbers are a subset of integers.\nExplanation: Natural numbers (1, 2, 3...) are included within the set of integers (...-2, -1, 0, 1, 2...). The other options are incorrect because real numbers include irrationals (not rationals), integers include negative numbers (not in natural numbers), and real numbers are a subset of complex numbers.\n\nAnswer 2: b. Egyptians\nExplanation: While other civilizations used base systems, the Egyptians are known for one of the earliest documented uses of a base-10 (decimal) system, though not positional like the Hindu-Arabic system.\n\nAnswer 3: False\nExplanation: The symbol 'i' was first used by Leonhard Euler. Gauss used 'i' later but did not originate its use.\n\nAnswer 4: zero\nExplanation: The use of zero as a placeholder is crucial for the Hindu-Arabic numeral system's positional notation, allowing for easy representation of larger numbers and efficient arithmetic.\n"}
